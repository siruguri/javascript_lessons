# JavaScript in the Browser

JavaScript also has some other data types built into it that make it
easy to manipulate behavior in the browser. For example, there is a
type that represents the tags in the browser source code, which are
also called "nodes" or "elements."

Each node is a separate "instance" but because all the nodes are of
the same type, they will have the same set of
properties/behaviors. However, as we saw with strings, the "values" of
these properties can be different. One property is that elements have
names - the name itself of course can be different for each element in
the HTML code.

A behavior you might expect from a node is the ability to list its
attributes, or to set the value of a specific attribute.
