#  Syntax and Semantics

In the browser console, you can type in 1+2, and it will evaluate it
to 3. The "semantics" or meaning of this "expression" is that we want
to add two numbers.

If we type in "cat" + "horse", we get "cathorse" - the semantics are
that two words are concatenated, but the [syntax](glossary/syntax.html) is the same as for
mathematical addition of two numbers.

When the same syntax is used with many semantics, it is referred to as
"[overloading](glossary/overloading.html)," specifically as "overloading an operator." The
"operator" in this case is the + sign.
