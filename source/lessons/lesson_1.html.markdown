# Introduction: The Hangman Game

In this JavaScript lesson, we are going to construct the Hangman Game - the user has to guess a word, one letter at a time.

This lesson will help us understand the basics of JavaScript, how it interacts with the browser, and how we set up an HTTP based client-server application.

We will break for "glossary updates" periodically where we have learned a lot of new terminology that is worth reviewing.
