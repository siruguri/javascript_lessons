# JavaScript Properties

The other meaning of a piece of data having a "type" is that the datum
has certain set of properties and behaviors. For example, any string
has a length and this is a property of the string. The "value" of this
property can be different for each string. For example, we think of
"age" as a property shared by all living things, even though the value
of this property is different for two living beings that have been alive
for different lengths of time.

Most programming languages come pre-packaged with some data types and
these have some properties and behaviors assigned to them. In
JavaScript, strings, apart from having the property of length, also
have the behavior of, for example, being "sliceable" into smaller
strings, have the case of letters in the string changed from lower- to
upper-case (and vice-versa,) and so on.

# Exercises

* Find the behavior/property that changes the case of all the characters in a string
* Find the behavior/property that helps pick a segment of a string
* Is there a behavior/property that lets you reverse the string?
